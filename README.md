## 🧠 How It Works

The AI uses **Q-Learning**, a reinforcement learning technique:
- **States**: Your last move (or "Start" initially).
- **Actions**: Rock, Paper, Scissors.
- **Rewards**:
  - AI wins → +1
  - You win → -1
  - Tie → 0

**Learning Formula**:
```lua
Q(s, a) = Q(s, a) + α * [reward + γ * max(Q(next_state)) - Q(s, a)]
```

The AI saves its learning progress in `q_table.json`, adapting to your play style over time.
